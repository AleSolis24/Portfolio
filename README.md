# My-Portfolio

## Description 

This reporsority is about my portfolio and how to make a website from scratch. Through out this project I realized that there were a lot of debugging and problem sloving on a lot of css element and HTML. The main issue i was facing was the work section of my website as most of my image were not displaying correctly and had to correct this using CSS
