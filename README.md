# My-Portfolio

## Description 

This reporsority is about my portfolio and how to make a website from scratch. Through out this project I realized that there were a lot of debugging and problem sloving on a lot of css element and HTML. The main issue i was facing was the work section of my website as most of my image were not displaying correctly and had to correct this using CSS

## Installation

## Usage 

My website is really easy to use. It currently has 4 nav bars to direct you to each section of my website. 1. About me 2. work 3 contact me 4. my resume(this link is still in the works to link my resume and contact information)
